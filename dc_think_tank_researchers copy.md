### **Methodology**
Research conducted through:
- Direct web searches of institutional websites
- Staff directory pages and web fetching
- Program-specific researcher listings
- Recent publications and Congressional testimony
- Media appearances and expert profiles
- Board and advisory council listings
- LinkedIn and professional networks

### **Database Characteristics:**
- **Geographic Focus**: All institutions DC-based or have major DC presence
- **Political Spectrum**: Ranges from progressive (CAP) to conservative (Heritage, AEI) to non-partisan (CSIS, RAND, Brookings) to restraint-focused (Quincy)
- **Research Approach**: Mix of traditional think tanks and "action tanks"
- **Funding Models**: Foundation-funded, corporate-funded, government contracts, individual donors

### **Usage Applications:**
This database is now prepared for:
- Contact information gathering and outreach
- Publication history and citation analysis
- Policy position mapping and tracking
- Network analysis and relationship mapping
- Expertise categorization by topic area
- Congressional testimony tracking
- Media appearance monitoring
- Career trajectory analysis
- Collaboration and co-authorship patterns
- Policy influence assessment

### **Notable Gaps & Limitations:**
- Some institutions (RAND, CFR) have larger staff but don't publish comprehensive directories
- Adjunct/nonresident fellows may not all be captured
- Staff turnover means some listings may be dated
- Government transitions (e.g., Mieke Eoyang to DoD) create gaps
- Some smaller programs or regional offices not fully documented

### **Recommendations for Maintenance:**
- Quarterly updates recommended for accuracy
- Track staff movements to/from government
- Monitor new program launches and fellows
- Update with Congressional testimony appearances
- Cross-reference with published work
